## CM12 Icon Pack for F-droid ##

CM12 Icon Pack based on [CM12 Theme Engine](https://github.com/cyngn/android_packages_themes_Template). 
Your ROM must include the NEW CM12 Theme Engine ! Please make sure this applies to your ROM first before installing this app. 

This Icon pack contains icons for the apps hosted on [F-droid FLOSS Repository] (https://f-droid.org/)

Following the guidelines of Google Material Design for Android Lollipop (Android 5). I'm planning to add progressively the more icons I can. Contributions are welcome (please visit [the material design website](http://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html)).
